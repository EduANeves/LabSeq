How to start this Rest API.

I used the Eclipse environment  with quarkus.

Execute ".\mvnw compile quarkus:dev" in eclipse terminal

Go to "localhost:8080" and execute the programme

Access to "localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui"  to  test in swagger
Just put on "n" the pretended value and the application will give the output with the sequence.
